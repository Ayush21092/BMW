        <h3>Why us?</h3>
        <p>We provide the best performance with a pinch of luxury and let the driver experience a sheer driving pleasure.
            The BMW has a very low center of gravity and can take turns like it's on rails. It also has incredible brakes
             and is light so it stops on a dime. This means it can run up on a curve at full speed, brake hard and hit the apex
              at the absolute last second. The straight 6-cylinder engine produces a large amount of torque past 2nd gear, 
              meaning is can accelerate briskly once at speed. It could come in and out of the runs a lot faster than the 
              big heavy Ford which had to brake early to keep from losing control in the turns.
